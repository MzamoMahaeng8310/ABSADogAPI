# ABSADogAPI
The API Framework 
This is a Maven project with these dependencies:
Rest Assured
TestNG
ExtentReports
JsonPath Validator

Please see the latest AllBreeds.html report for the full results.

Clone the project and use TestNG as the test runner. The only file that needs to be run is the DogBreeds.java class as I mentioned, using TestNG.

Then refresh the project.
After that, you can once again open Extent Report named AllBreeds.html.

Thank you so much.
I appreciate the opportunity.
